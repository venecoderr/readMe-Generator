# readMe Generator

## Description
I wanted to test my knowledge on NodeJS and make my life as a developer easier at the same time so I built this app that takes the input for your readMe sections and builds up the file for you, it includes all of the elements of a high quality readMe

## Installation

The app doesn't require installation, but you'll need to download inquirer, for that:

Use the 'npm init -y' command to initialize NPM
Use 'npm i inquirer@8.2.4' to install inquirer (make sure to download version 8.2.4)

## Usage

Use the command 'node index.js' to run the app
